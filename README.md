# Google's FooBar

Google Foobar is a secret way of recruiting top developers and programmers from around the world. \
It includes challenges occurring instantly on the screen of the developer when they search for some specific keywords related to coding.

This repository contains all of my own solutions to those questions.\
Each directory is a different Level in the challenge.\
In each directory, there are all the challenges in the Level.\
There is a readme file inside the directory of each challenge, explaining the challenge and providing the test cases that Google provided. \
Notice there were multiple test cases that didn't get revealed to us for every challenge.

Most of my answers are written in python, but some are written in Java.
